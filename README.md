### ReactNative-TheGuessGame
Developed this Hybrid Mobile App which is named as “The Guess Game” by using React Native.
=> This Game has 3 screens, the first one is the main screen where user enters any number between 1 and 99
=> After entering the number, a user would press the Start Game Button, the next screen will be popped up.
=> In this Screen, The app will guess the number and a user will help by telling if the number which is suggested is smaller or greater.
=> The guess list would also be shown to the user so that he can track the guesses.
=> When the guess is correct, the next screen will be appeared. And that’s the game over screen. Here user will also be told about how many guesses have been made to guess the correct number.
=> On this Screen, a user would also press the start new game button if he wants to play again.
